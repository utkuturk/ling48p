# Good Enough by Ferreria and Patson

- the idea is to challenge the overarching thought that human parser tries to understand everything.
- people do not really required to do some articulate work behind the scenes, they just need to nod or some motor action, nothing fancy.
- the system might not even resolve the ambiguities
- and the experiment may bias subjects towards trying even harder.
- system may even ignore some elements and not compute specific structure.

#### __Ferreria Findings in 2002__
1. people often obtain shallow understanding of a sentence's meaning.
2. people sometimes outright misunderstand sentences.

_How many of each type of animal did Moses take on the ark?_ (Erickson and Matteson 1981)
- Most people overlook the anomaly in the question 'Where should the authorities bury the survivors?' 
- People understand the sentence __well enough__ to realize what they are asked about, but __not depply enough__ to appreciate the difference between the details.
- __There are lots of evidence for incomplete and shallow representation__
#### __Frazier 1999__ 
- Mary and John saved $100
  - each or together? They do not specify the information, they do when there is enough context for interpretation

#### __Sanford and Sturt 2002__ underspecification > computational advantages 

### Ferreria _Again_ 2001
- We look at the garden sentences and when the misunderstood but do we really  ultimately understood correctly.
- the form of the question may lead the high percentage of incorrect _yes_ responses, it might have reinstated the original misparse.
#### Patson 2006
- participants were given similar sentences and then asked to recall them immediately or after a delay. No yes\no questions.

#### Ferreria 2003
- the dog ws bitten by the man: college students mostly give the wrong answer even if the sentence is completely grammatical.

> Paper will first deal with the effects of local coherence. Then, ERP and heuristics. Lastly, mechanism that helps people in non-error-free utterances, as they expect spoken discourse to be.

### effects of local coherence
- heuristic generates challenges the parser when it tries to integrate the other words in the sentence.
- Local meaning disrupts the global interpretation
- local coherence effects supports the Sausage Machine, which assumes PPP creates local parses, which are put together by SSS.
- Ferreria and Fodor also found the effects of __mere local coherence__.
  - Subjects are asked to read and judge ungrammatical sentences.
  - The ungrammatical sentences were incorrectly judged to be grammatical on about one third of the trials, which was much higher than for ordinary ungrammatical sentences.
    - They mostly go back to verb fixed and the NP following, so they know which one of the local sequences interfere with the global grammaticity.
    - This type of sentences and trials shows that system works by cobbling together local analyses, and thus, has difficulty when local analyses cannot be integrated into global structure.
    - Also, ERP recordings supports the heuristic use.
      - Even though the problem was semantic, not N400, but P600 _syntactic revision index_ was observed.
      - It is because the parser automatically ignored the sentence and went for the possible meaning, Ignoreing _a fax shot a poacher_, understanding _a poacher shot a fox_.
  - Also, Tabor found that even locally plausible sequences interfere with global processing.
